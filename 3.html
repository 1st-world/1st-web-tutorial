        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia에서 자세히 알아보기">JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        <br>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model(DOM).</p>
